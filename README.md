# HSK-3.0-Word-List
New 2021 HSK 3.0 Word List from Official PDF

In March, 2021, the Chinese Ministry of Education Released a new HSK word list for the Chinese Proficiency Standards Test 汉语水平考试.
The new word list was released as a non-searchable PDF and my request for the native files was rejected.
I used different OCR software to recognize the Chinese characters and created a CSV file with the results. 
These results have been cross referenced with other available word lists in order to ensure accuracy. I believe that this is the most accurate and complete list available.

Column Definitions
==================

HSK_3_0_Level
-------------
This is the HSK Level that the word is contained in. The levels are split into: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7-9. 
Words in levels 7,8,9 are grouped into one group called "7-9".
Please note that some words can be found in multiple levels such as 白.

| HSK_3_0_Level | HSK_3_0_No | OCR | Hanzi | Hanzi_Alternate | HSK_Level_Usage |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | 
| 1 | 6 | 白（形） | 白 |  | 形 | 
| 1 | 7 | 白天 | 白天 |  |  |  
| 2 | 6 | 白色 | 白色 |  |  |  
| 3 | 9 | 白（副） | 白 |  | 副 | 


HSK_3_0_No
----------
Every word in each level is numbered with the first word of each level starting again at 1.

OCR
---
This is the raw result of the OCR for each entry in the PDF. This column is just for reference as it is not very useful due to the addition of other non-word information such as the intended usage of the word in that particular HSK level (eg. "白（形）" in level 1 and "白（副）" in level 3)  

Hanzi
-----
The hanzi extracted from the OCR column.

Hanzi_Alternate
--------------
The alternate hanzi extracted from the OCR column like in the case of "有（一）些":

| HSK_3_0_Level | HSK_3_0_No | OCR | Hanzi | Hanzi_Alternate | HSK_Level_Usage |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | 
| 1 |	445 |	有（一）些	| 有些	| 有一些 | |


HSK_Level_Usage
--------------
This is the how the word was intended to be used in that HSK Level as in the case of "白" shown above.


Please Help
==========
1. Please let me know of any issues, typos, or suggestions for improvement!
2. Use this list for your own projects! My main intention is to use this list to create an anki deck for new HSK 3.0 words.
